# Time Duration Calculator

This [program](main.py) will calculate the duration between two times.

I had to do invoices for freelance work and this helped me, maybe it'll help you.

## Instructions

Type in the terminal:

`python main.py`

The UI will then prompt input times and output duration.

## Import

On importing this as a module, run:

`main(start, end)`

> Input start time and end time in 24 hour format, e.g. 1203, 356, 2315
>
> it will return a list of values e.g. ('9:48', 9.8, 588)
>
> The function return 4 values:
>
> - Hours and Minutes
> - Hours
> - Minutes
> - Message
>
> Message is formatted description of the returned durations
